# Sonar_Project
Sonar / Satellite Project with CU EarthLab Analytics Hub

I am examining potential linkages between surface features and the vertical structure of ocean productivity and biomass in the California Current System (CCS). 

Previous versions used Pytorch framework, now switched to scikitlearn MLP Regressor. 

Random Forest better fits the dimenions of the sonar and satellite data, so that machine learning method is currently being utilized in lieu of neural networks.
